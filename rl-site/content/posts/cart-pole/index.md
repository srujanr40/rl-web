## Introduction to the problem

The cartpole problem involves a movable cart on a track with a pole attached to its center. The only actions the agent can perform are to move the cart a step to the left, or a step to the right. The agent can fully observe the state of the environment at any given time step. The pole on the cart can rotate freely and is weighed down by gravity.

## The Goal
The goal of the problem is to get the agent to keep the pole on the cart upright. To do so, the agent needs to move the cart to the left or right just the right amount at each time step such that the movement of the cart balances the movement of the pole against gravity.
