The only actions the agent can perform are to move the cart a step to the left, or a step to the right. The agent can fully observe the state of the environment at any given time step. The pole on the cart can rotate freely and is weighed down by gravity.\nDemo of the problem with the agent taking random actions\n{{include image here}}\nThe Goal # The goal of the problem is to get the agent to keep the pole on the cart upright.
