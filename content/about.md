Reinforcement learning is kinda cool. An agent can observe its environment, take actions, and receive rewards. By leveraging these characteristics of an agent, we can get it to learn from its actions in an environment, and thereby learn what actions it should take to achieve the state we desire it to achieve.

I've been working on projects surrounding reinforcement learning, tackling common problems that require an agent to learn from its environment in order to be solved. This website serves as a compendium of the problems I've tackled, my approach to solving the problems, and the results I've achieved.

I used Hugo as my framework of choice because it is great at generating static websites. The themes (such as the [Blowfish Theme](https://blowfish.page/) that I am using here) make it easy to be able to add new static pages when I work on new projects with the simple inclusing of a new markdown file, without needing to worry too much about the visuals as the theme will take care of that. 10/10 would recommend.

If any of this is interesting to you, feel free to reach out!
